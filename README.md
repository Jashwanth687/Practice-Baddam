###### One republic 


OneRepublic blends pop hooks with real emotional depth.Ryan Tedder’s voice carries heartbreak hope, and **fire**.The lyrics feel honest and easy to connect to.Their songs feel cinematic,perfect for late-night drives.Each track tells a story that feels personal.From Apologize to **Counting Stars** they stay with you.
