## Code Fencing Example

The following Python code snippet creates a new dictionary by sorting an existing
dictionary based on its values in ascending order. This is useful when you want to
organize data by value instead of by key.

```python
new_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}
